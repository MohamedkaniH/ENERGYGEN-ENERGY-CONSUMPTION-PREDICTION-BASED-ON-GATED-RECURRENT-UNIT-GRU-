# ENERGYGEN-ENERGY-CONSUMPTION-PREDICTION-BASED-ON-GATED-RECURRENT-UNIT-GRU-
A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) was adopted for the intergration of a predictive model for energy usage conditioned on several environmental and operational factors. The dataset would include time-stamped features that include temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure but are real-world collected. It is through rigorous preprocessing and feature engineering that the temporal dependencies really capture energy usage patterns in this model. Results showed some notable improvements in prediction precision and a minimal number of errors in the making of forecasts. The ability of the model to be very strong against disturbances, irregularity, or complete variability in different time intervals is attested to by applying criteria such as (RMSE) and (MAE). The results hold valuable means of enhancing energy management strategies through GRU-based models towards realizations of energy consumption forecasting.
